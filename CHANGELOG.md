- **Full dataset is available now!** Note: some of knives are misaligned in the orginal ShapeNet. We picked those misaligned ones and stored them into **knife_misaligned.txt**.

- We've split the semantic ids of normal chairs (**four** legs) and swivel chairs (**five** legs with rotational symmetries). **Before**, the four legs of normal chairs have semantic id: **10, 11, 12, 13** and the five legs of swivel chairs have semantic id: **10, 11, 12, 13, 14**. **Now**, the four legs of normal chairs have semantic id: **17, 18, 19, 20** and semantic ids of swivel chairs are the same as before.
